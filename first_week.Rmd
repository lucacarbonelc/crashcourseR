# Welcome to the R Crash Course!

R is an open source programming language, extremely versatile and increasingly used in academia and industry for data analysis. Together with RMarkdown, RStudio can be employed to build personal [websites](https://www.amyorben.com) or pages (like this one!).

<br>

R is good for several reasons:

| • It's open source (you can always check what happens under the hood);
| • New methods are continuously implemented;
| • Great R community (developers and users) online, where to always find (or ask for) help. For example, [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com);
| • Optimal for open science: clear syntax that makes easy to replicate results;
| • It's free.
